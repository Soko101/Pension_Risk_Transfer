Optimizing Pension Risk Transfer (PRT) Pricing Models Using Advanced Data Analytics and Machine Learning Techniques
**Objective:**

The objective of my research project is to develop and refine pricing models for 
Pension Risk Transfer (PRT) products using advanced data analytics and
machine learning techniques to improve accuracy, efficiency, and risk management.

**Key Components:**

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**
    - Collect historical data on pension plans, mortality rates, interest rates, and other relevant factors.
    - Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
    
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Perform EDA to understand the key factors influencing PRT pricing.
    - Visualize data trends and patterns using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
    
3. **Custom Mortality Curves:**
    - Analyze population and plan-specific experience to develop custom mortality curves.
    - Compare traditional actuarial methods with machine learning approaches for mortality rate estimation.
      
4. **Machine Learning Model Development:**
    - Implement machine learning models (e.g., regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict liability cash flows and reserves.
    - Use Python libraries like scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.
      
5. **Asset-Liability Management (ALM) Modeling:**
    - Develop ALM models to simulate different investment strategies and their impact on pension plan funding.
    - Evaluate the performance of these strategies under various economic scenarios.
      
6. **Risk and Sensitivity Analysis:**
    - Conduct sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of different assumptions on PRT pricing.
    - Assess the risk associated with different pricing models and identify potential improvements.
      
7. **Process Improvement:**
    - Identify areas where automation and process optimization can enhance the efficiency of PRT pricing.
    - Leverage tools like SQL for database management and Excel for financial modeling.
      
8. **Results and Recommendations:**
    - Present findings on the effectiveness of machine learning models in improving PRT pricing accuracy.
    - Provide recommendations for integrating advanced analytics into Prudentialâ€™s existing pricing infrastructure.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- Improved accuracy in PRT pricing models, leading to better financial outcomes.
- Enhanced ability to manage and mitigate risks associated with pension plans.
- Demonstration of the value of combining traditional actuarial methods with modern data science techniques.
